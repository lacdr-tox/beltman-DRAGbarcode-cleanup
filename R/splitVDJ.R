# File: splitVDJ.R
#
# Script to split barcodes from the genetic 'barcode mouse' construct as generated in
# the lab of Ton Schumacher (NKI, NL) in its remaining constant V, D and J elements and
# the modified elements (additions/deletions) in between those constant parts.
#
# Expected input: a data frame with a column named var, which contains the barcode names
# 								(a specific part of the sequence)
#
# Output: 				two data frames are created (add.del.ok and add.del.err), which contain
# 								columns with the remaining constant parts and inserted/deleted parts
